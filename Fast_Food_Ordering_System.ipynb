        "\n",
        "Input Validation / Robustness\n",
        "To keep the system stable and user-friendly, the following rules are applied:\n",
        "- No special characters allowed (@, #, $, %, &amp;, *)\n",
        "- No letters allowed (only numbers are accepted)\n",
        "- No extremely large numbers allowed\n",
        "- Only menu-related numbers (1–4) are accepted\n",
        "If a user gives wrong input, the system shows an error and asks again.\n",
